Hi, there. 

I'm Vivek Pal, a programmer by choice and also the guy managing this little internet space and here's my [blog](/archives).

I'm interested in Computer Science and Physics in general. Particularly, my interests lie within [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), [IR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval) and [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) branching out to [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence). I think we are close to creating an sentient artificial intelligence... nah, we're [far away](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/chief-scientist-at-baidua_b_9187572.html) in fact.

I also frequently read articles (sometimes papers), and watch [TED](https://www.ted.com) videos to quench my thirst for the kind of knowledge I seek.

To take a break from the things mentioned above, I switch to watching sci-fi films, TV shows and sometimes Japanese animes (trust me they're good).

My [Myers-Briggs Type Indicator(MBTI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator) is INTP (Introverted Intuitive Thinking Perceiving). Also, means that my personality aligns to some level with people such as Albert Einstein, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Take the test [here](https://www.16personalities.com).
