Finally, it has happened. Back story -- I've been [procrastinating](http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) for a long time now to start my own personal website and set up a blog. But now this is going to be my very first post. Thinking a bit about what exactly to write about in this blog post, I decided to make it a colophon. 

## Hosting
This website is hosted on Gihub Pages from its Gihub repository. Many thanks to Github for free hosting, being reliable, and suiting my needs.

## Hexo
I literally procrastinated for a whole week just over deciding which static site generator to choose. There are many out there. Finally, settled with [Hexo](https://www.hexo.io) which is NodeJS based and is simple and straightforward without any bells and whistles.

## Version Control
Git used for version control and source code stored in a Github repository.

## Theme
I have adapted the look for this website from the [Cactus-Dark](https://github.com/probberechts/cactus-dark) Hexo theme. Thanks to [Pieter Robberechts](https://github.com/probberechts) for his work.
